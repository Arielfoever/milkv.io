# Introduction

Duoâ€™s CPU CV1800B integrates CVITEK TPU for intelligent detection.

TPU is an AI acceleration engine for deep learning neural networks, which can be used to accelerate image classification, object detection, face detection and recognition, segmentation, LSTM, and more. The main function of TPU is to offload CPU work and accelerate computer vision and voice-related operations.
