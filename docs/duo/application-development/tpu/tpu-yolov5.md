# Introduction

Duo CPU CV1800B integrated CVITEK TPU for smart detection

TPU is an AI acceleration engine for deep learning neural network, which can be used to accelerate image classification, object detection, face detection and recognition, segmenataion, and LSTM, etc... The main function of TPU is to offload CPU work and to accelerate Computer Vision and Speech related operations
