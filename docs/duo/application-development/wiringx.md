# Introduction
wiringX is a library that allows developers to control the GPIO of various platforms with generic and uniform functions. By using wiringX, the same code will run on all platforms supported by wiringX, natively.

This article will be divided into the following four parts to introduce how to develop applications on Duo using wiringX:

1. wiringX APIs
2. Basic usage code demonstration
3. Configuration of the application compilation environment based on wiringX
4. Introduction to some demos and projects implemented using wiringX

If you are already familiar with the usage of wiringX, you can directly refer to our sample code:  [duo-examples](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples)

The wiringX pin numbering of Milk-V Duo is consistent with the pin name numbering of Duo. However, the LED control pin is not available on the 40-pin physical pinout, and its wiringX pin number is `25`.

</div>

Please note that many of Duo's pins have multipurpose functionality. When using `wiringX` to control the functions of each pin, it is important to confirm the current state of the pin to ensure it matches the desired functionality. If it doesn't, you can use the `duo-pinmux` command to switch it to the desired function.

Please refer to the detailed usage instructions for more informationï¼š[pinmux](https://milkv.io/docs/duo/application-development/pinmux).

## 2. Code example

### GPIO Usage Example

Here is an example of working with GPIO. It will toggle pin 20 on Duo every 1 second, pulling it high and then low. The physical pin number for pin 20 is `15` in the WiringX numbering system.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <wiringx.h>

int main() {
    int DUO_GPIO = 15;

    if(wiringXSetup("duo", NULL) == -1) {
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    if(wiringXValidGPIO(DUO_GPIO) != 0) {
        printf("Invalid GPIO %d\n", DUO_GPIO);
    }

    pinMode(DUO_GPIO, PINMODE_OUTPUT);

    while(1) {
        printf("Duo GPIO (wiringX) %d: High\n", DUO_GPIO);
        digitalWrite(DUO_GPIO, HIGH);
        sleep(1);
        printf("Duo GPIO (wiringX) %d: Low\n", DUO_GPIO);
        digitalWrite(DUO_GPIO, LOW);
        sleep(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
After compiling and running it on Duo, you can use a multimeter or an oscilloscope to measure the state of pin 20 and verify if it matches the expected behavior.

You can also use the onboard LED pin to verify the behavior. By observing the on/off state of the LED, you can intuitively determine if the program is executing correctly. The WiringX pin number for the LED is `25`. Simply modify the code mentioned above by replacing pin `15` with pin `25`. However, please note that the default firmware has a script to control LED blinking on startup, which needs to be disabled. You can refer to the example explanation for [blink](#blink) below for instructions on how to disable it.

### I2C Usage Example

Here is an example of I2C communication:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <wiringx.h>

#define I2C_DEV "/dev/i2c-1"

#define I2C_ADDR 0x04

int main(void)
{
    int fd_i2c;
    int data = 0;

    if(wiringXSetup("duo", NULL) == -1) {
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    if ((fd_i2c = wiringXI2CSetup(I2C_DEV, I2C_ADDR)) <0) {
        printf("I2C Setup failed: %d\n", fd_i2c);
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    // TODO
}
```

### SPI Usage Example

Here is an example of SPI communication:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdint.h>

#include <wiringx.h>

int main(void)
{
    int fd_spi;

    if(wiringXSetup("duo", NULL) == -1) {
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    if ((fd_spi = wiringXSPISetup(0, 500000)) <0) {
        printf("SPI Setup failed: %d\n", fd_spi);
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    // TODO
}
```

### UART Usage Example

Here is an example of UART communication using UART4 on pins 4/5:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#include <wiringx.h>

int main() {
    struct wiringXSerial_t wiringXSerial = {115200, 8, 'n', 1, 'n'};
    char buf[1024];
    int str_len = 0;
    int i;
    int fd;

    if(wiringXSetup("duo", NULL) == -1) {
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    if ((fd = wiringXSerialOpen("/dev/ttyS4", wiringXSerial)) < 0) {
        printf("Open serial device failed: %d\n", fd);
        wiringXGC();
        return -1;
    }

    wiringXSerialPuts(fd, "Duo Serial Test\n");

    while(1)
    {
        str_len = wiringXSerialDataAvail(fd);
        if (str_len > 0) {
            i = 0;
            while (str_len--)
            {
                buf[i++] = wiringXSerialGetChar(fd);
            }
            printf("Duo UART receive: %s\n", buf);
        }
    }

    wiringXSerialClose(fd);

    return 0;
}
```
Testing Method:

The RX of the USB to serial converter cable is connected to pin 4 (UART4_TX) of Duo, the TX of the serial cable is connected to pin 5 (UART4_RX) of Duo, and the GND of the serial cable is connected to the GND of Duo. On the computer, configure the COM port and parameters using a serial debugging tool.

The compiled executable of the above program is named `uart_test`. After uploading it to Duo via SSH and running it, you should be able to see the string `Duo Serial Test` received in the serial tool on your computer. If you send the string `Hello World` from the serial tool, you will also see the corresponding string received on the Duo's terminal. This confirms that the serial communication is functioning correctly.

## 3. Development Environment Setup

### Build environment on Ubuntu20.04

You can also use Ubuntu installed in a virtual machine, Ubuntu installed via WSL on Windows, or Ubuntu-based systems using Docker.

- Install the tools that compile dependencies
  ```
  sudo apt-get install wget git make
  ```
- Get example source code
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples.git
  ```

- Prepare compilation environment
  ```
  cd duo-examples
  source envsetup.sh
  ```
  The first time you source it, the required SDK package will be automatically downloaded, which is approximately 180MB in size. Once downloaded, it will be automatically extracted to the `duo-examples` directory with the name `duo-sdk`. When source it next time, if the directory already exists, it will not be downloaded again.

- Compile testing  

  Take hello-world as an example, enter the hello-world directory and execute make:
  ```
  cd hello-world
  make
  ```
  After the compilation is successful, send the generated `helloworld` executable program to the Duo device through the network port or the RNDIS network. For example, the RNDIS method supported by the [default firmware](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk/releases), Duoâ€™s IP is 192.168.42.1, the user name is `root`, and the password is `milkv`.
  ```
  scp helloworld root@192.168.42.1:/root/
  ```
  After sending successfully, run `./helloworld` in the terminal logged in via ssh or serial port, and it will print `Hello, World!`
  ```
  [root@milkv]~# ./helloworld
  Hello, World!
  ```
  **At this point, our compilation and development environment is ready for use.**

### How to create your own project

You can simply copy existing examples and make necessary modifications. For instance, if you need to manipulate a GPIO, you can refer to the `blink` example. LED blinking is achieved by controlling the GPIO's voltage level. The current SDK utilizes the WiringX library for GPIO operations, which has been adapted specifically for Duo. You can find the platform initialization and GPIO control methods in the `blink.c` code for reference.

- Create your own project directory called `my-project`.
- Copy the `blink.c` and `Makefile` files from the `blink` example to the `my-project` directory.
- Rename `blink.c` to your desired name, such as `gpio_test.c`.
- Modify the `Makefile` by changing `TARGET=blink` to `TARGET=gpio_test`.
- Modify `gpio_test.c` to implement your own code logic.
- Execute the `make` command to compile.
- Send the generated `gpio_test` executable program to Duo for execution.
  
Note:

- Creating a new project directory is not mandatory to be placed within the `duo-examples` directory. You can choose any location based on your preference. Before executing the `make` compilation command, it is sufficient to load the compilation environment from the `duo-examples` directory (source /PATH/TO/duo-examples/envsetup.sh).
- Within the terminal where the compilation environment (envsetup.sh) is loaded, avoid compiling Makefile projects for other platforms such as ARM or X86. If you need to compile projects for other platforms, open a new terminal.

## 4. Explanation of each example

### [hello-world](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples/tree/main/hello-world)

A simple example that doesn't interact with Duo peripherals, only prints the output "Hello, World!" to verify the development environment.

### [blink](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples/tree/main/blink)

This example demonstrates how to control an LED connected to a GPIO pin. It uses the WiringX library to toggle the GPIO pin's voltage level, resulting in the LED blinking.  

The `blink.c` code includes platform initialization and GPIO manipulation methods from the WiringX library.

To test the `blink` example, which involves LED blinking, you need to disable the script responsible for the automatic LED blinking on the default firmware of Duo. In the Duo terminal, execute the following command:
```
mv /mnt/system/blink.sh /mnt/system/blink.sh_backup && sync
```
This command renames the LED blinking script. After restarting Duo, the LED will no longer blink. 

Once you have finished testing the `blink` program implemented in C, if you want to restore the LED blinking script, you can rename it back using the following command and then restart Duo:
```
mv /mnt/system/blink.sh_backup /mnt/system/blink.sh && sync
```

### [I2C](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples/tree/main/i2c)

#### [bmp280_i2c](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-examples/tree/main/i2c/bmp280_i2c)

This example code shows how to interface the Milk-V Duo with the popular BMP280 temperature and air pressure sensor manufactured by Bosch.

## 5. Compile wiringX

Duo firmware already contains the compiled wiringX library (/usr/lib/libwiringx.so) and can be used directly. If you need to compile the source code of wiringX to generate the library, you can compile it as follows.

We compile it on an Ubuntu host or other Linux distribution.

*Note: Part of Duo's wiringX code has not yet been integrated into the upstream wiringX repo. In actual use, please give priority to using the wiringX library in Duo firmware.

### Download wiringX source code

```
git clone https://github.com/wiringX/wiringX.git
```

### Modify CMakeLists.txt

Enter the code directory:
```
cd wiringX
```

The wiringX project is compiled using cmake. You need to modify CMakeLists.txt through `vi` or other editors to add the cross-compilation toolchain and compilation parameters:

```diff {9-12}
diff --git a/CMakeLists.txt b/CMakeLists.txt
index 8909393..6918181 100644
--- a/CMakeLists.txt
+++ b/CMakeLists.txt

     # Create uninstall target template file, if it doesn't exist...
```

There are two variables that need to be noted and configured according to your own file path:
- **CMAKE_C_COMPILER**: The path to gcc in the cross-compilation toolchain
- **CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER**: path to g++ in the cross-compilation toolchain

Download link for cross-compilation toolchain: [host-tools.tar.gz](https://sophon-file.sophon.cn/sophon-prod-s3/drive/23/03/07/16/host-tools.tar.gz). You can download and unzip it through the wget command:
```bash
wget https://sophon-file.sophon.cn/sophon-prod-s3/drive/23/03/07/16/host-tools.tar.gz
tar -xf host-tools.tar.gz
```

If you have ever compiled [duo-buildroot-sdk](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-buildroot-sdk), the `host-tools` directory in its root directory is the directory of the cross toolchain. There is no need to re-download, you can directly modify the `CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` field to specify the directory. Or create a soft link pointing to the directory.

### Modify code

Since the time-related definitions in the cross toolchain are slightly different from those in wiringX, add the following two lines of modification:

```diff {9,10}
diff --git a/src/wiringx.c b/src/wiringx.c
index 034674a..4171a75 100644

    are taken from wiringPi */

```

### Compile

Compiling in cmake will create some intermediate directories and files, so we create a new build directory and enter this directory to complete the compilation:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After compilation is completed, the `libwiringx.so` generated in the current `build` directory is the wiringX library we need.
