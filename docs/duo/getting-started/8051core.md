# Introduction

The CPU used by Duo contains an 8051 core. The 8051 subsystem is located in a module that is independently powered by the RTC. The subsystem is configured with an 8051, an I2C/UART/SPI NOR/SD controller, a Timer/WDT, interrupt management, and a Mailbox IP. The system software can use the 8051 to manage wake-up conditions and wake up the system while it is in sleep mode, and communicate with external devices through peripheral controllers.

# 8051 core compilation guide

Source Code: [github](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-8051.git).

run:
```
git clone https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-8051.git
chmod -R 777 ./duo-8051
cd duo-8051/sdcc/mars/project/base_project
make clean && make
```
After successful compilation, the compiled firmware mars_mcu_fw.bin can be found in sdcc/mars/project/base_project/output.


# How to load firmware

First download the firmware and tools and unzip the zip package：[firmware.zip](https://github.com/milkv-duo/duo-8051/releases/download/Duo-8051-V1.0/firmware.zip).

Ⅰ. Load firmware in 8051-SRAM:
        1. Copy 8051_up, mars_mcu_fw.bin, and blink.sh into /mnt/data, and grant execution and read permissions.
        2. Execute 8051_up to automatically update the firmware and start the 8051 core.
        3. Execute blink.sh. This script will send data to the 8051 core and cause the blue LED to flash (please confirm that /mnt/system/blink.sh has been removed before executing this script).
        
        Note: The 8051 kernel firmware cannot exceed 8KB when running this method. Exceeding the limit may cause it to not run.

Ⅱ.Load firmware in DDR memory:
        1. Change the memory allocation in the SDK and modify build/boards/[chip model]/[board config]/memmap.py.

          Add the following content in MemoryMap:
```
# ==============
# 8051
# ==============
CHIP8051_SIZE = 512 * SIZE_1K
CHIP8051_ADDR = DRAM_BASE + DRAM_SIZE - CHIP8051_SIZE
```

          Modify the following content:
```
# ==============
# C906L FreeRTOS
# ==============
FREERTOS_SIZE = 768 * SIZE_1K
# FreeRTOS is after 8051
FREERTOS_ADDR = CHIP8051_ADDR - FREERTOS_SIZE
FSBL_C906L_START_ADDR = FREERTOS_ADDR
```

        2. Recompile the firmware and burn it to the DUO board.
        3. Copy 8051_up, mars_mcu_fw.bin, blink.sh, and 8051_boot_cfg.ini into /mnt/data, and grant execution and read permissions.
        4. Execute 8051_up to automatically update the firmware and start the 8051 core.
        5. Execute blink.sh. This script will send information to the 8051 core and cause the blue LED to flash (please confirm that /mnt/system/blink.sh has been removed before executing this script).

        Note: If you want to customize the DDR memory size of 8051 to store firmware, please modify:
        ```
        CHIP8051_SIZE = 512 * SIZE_1K
        ```
         in which 512 is the custom size, and modify the address in "8051_boot_cfg.ini" to be the custom address. 
         
         The DUO address calculation formula is "2147483648+ 64*1048576-[custom size]*1024".

         The DUO-256M address calculation formula is "2147483648+256*1048576-[custom size]*1024".
         
         (note that when filling the address to config file, it must be converted into a hexadecimal address 0xXXXXXXX.)
