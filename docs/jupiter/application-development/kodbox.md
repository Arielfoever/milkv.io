The image file name format is: milkv-jupiter-bianbu-\*-`kodbox`-\*.zip

After downloading, refer to [Install OS Image](https://milkv.io/docs/jupiter/getting-started/boot) to install it.

After booting up, execute the `ip a` command in the serial port or check the router web user interface to obtain the IP address of Jupiter. Use the IP address to access the `Kodbox` web interface in the PC browser. Follow the instructions for simple settings and you can use it.
