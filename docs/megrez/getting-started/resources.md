### Fedora 41 System (by [Fedora-V Force](https://github.com/fedora-riscv))

The Fedora-V Force (FVF) is a technical team focused on porting and building the Linux kernel and Fedora distribution based on the RISC-V architecture, as well as firmware development. The team is committed to creating a more refined Fedora distribution and promoting the Linux open-source software ecosystem on RISC-V. Team members are from the Fedora community and RISC-V open-source enthusiasts, with years of technical expertise in firmware, U-Boot, the Linux kernel, Fedora, and other foundational software domains. They are also deeply involved in the RISC-V open architecture and its open-source ecosystem. Under the guidance of RISC-V ambassador Wei Fu, the team maintains the largest Fedora on RISC-V compilation system in China, independently compiling multiple Fedora versions from 36 to rawhide, and adapting to all mainstream RISC-V development boards on the market. This has significantly advanced the adoption of RISC-V as a major Fedora architecture. Additionally, the team actively participates in upstreaming open source code, adhering to Fedora's "upstream first" policy.
