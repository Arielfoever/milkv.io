# Build image

Prepare the Compilation Environment. Using a local Ubuntu system, the officially supported compilation environment is `Ubuntu Jammy 22.04.x amd64` only!

If you are using other Linux distributions, we strongly recommend that you use the Docker environment to compile to reduce the probability of compilation errors.

The following describes the compilation methods in the two environments.

## 1. Compiled using Ubuntu 22.04

### Packages to be installed

### Get SDK Source Code

### 1). One-click Compilation

## 2. Compiled using Docker

### Pull SDK code on Linux host

### 1). One-click compilation using Docker
